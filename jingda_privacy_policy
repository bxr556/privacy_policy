Welcome to the Jingda app for Android. 

We take your privacy seriously. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your choices.

## Data we collect and why

We do not collect sensitive categories of personal information (e.g., political opinions, health data) and we do not build advertising profiles.

## How we use your data

- Provide core functionality (location sharing, map display).

## Legal bases (where applicable)

- Consent: for location sharing (Driver must explicitly start sharing).
- Contract: to provide app services you request.

These services may process data (e.g., IP address, device identifiers) required for connectivity, security, and service operations.

## Data storage and retention

- Driver locations: stored in RTDB while sharing is active; retention is minimal and controlled by the app logic or your administrative policy. You may stop sharing anytime.
- Account data: retained while your account exists. You may request deletion (see “Your choices and controls”).

## Data sharing

- Driver location is shared only with intended recipients inside the app (e.g., selected passengers) to fulfill the tracking feature.
- We do not sell personal data.
- We share data with infrastructure providers (Firebase/Google) strictly to deliver app functionality.
